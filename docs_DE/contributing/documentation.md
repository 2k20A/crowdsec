# Contributing to documentation

This section describes how to contribute to {{crowdsec.name}} documentation.
Most likely, you will need to start with [setting up so you can write/view documentation locally](/contributing/documentation/#working-locally-on-documentation).

## Working locally on documentation

We are using [mkdocs](www.mkdocs.org) to write and view the documentation of {{crowdsec.name}}.
Thus the first step is to install mkdocs : https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation
Once the setup done, you can start a local mkdocs server like this `mkdocs serve` or `~/.local/bin/mkdocs serve`.

You can then fire your favorite browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and you should be viewing the documentation.
When you do changes, you don't need to restart the service, mkdocs will refresh itself to display the latest version !
